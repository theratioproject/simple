# Simple

The Simple Intelligent and Modular Programming Language and Environment</br>
Current Version : 0.3.34
![simple-repl](https://i.imgur.com/qx5bbc3.png)

### About Simple
SIMPLE is a plain and innovative programming with multi-paradigm. It can be embedded in C/C++ projects. The language is portable to various OS including windows, macOS, any linux and unix distros and other OS. The language is small and fast.

### Features
Simple has features every programming language will have such as variable declarations, functional programming, Object oriented programming etc and more to come. It houses all these features as it parent architecture comes from **C**. Simple is weakly typed, no explicit end of line required and can be embedded in C and C++ projects. Portability with javascript is a major goal we're trying and going to achieve.

[![Download SIMPLE](https://a.fsdn.com/con/app/sf-download-button)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/simple-lang/files/s0.3.303/)
### Downloading & Installing SIMPLE.
Simple has compilers that can be installed in our Windows/Linux/Mac systems. Simple can either be cloned, downloaded as zip or gotten from [here](https://simple-lang.sourceforge.io/)
Below are the procedures for installing on each system respectively.

#### Installing on Windows.
This is quite the easiest installation. Download the windows type file from [here](https://simple-lang.sourceforge.io/) and run.

#### Installing on Linux
After downloading simple from either methods listed above, unzip/move into the SIMPLE folder from your console and follow the instructions below.
```sh
$ cd build & chmod +x Linux-Build.sh
```
##### Installing SIMPLE as a program file alone.
This method of installation, installs **SIMPLE** as a program file without building its debug folder.
```sh
$ sudo sh ./Linux-Build.sh -c & sudo sh ./Linux-Build.sh -i
```
##### Installing SIMPLE for debugging purpose.
This method of installation does not install **SIMPLE** to the system but only installs the debugging folder *s0.3.34* and houses four folders:
+ bin
    - simple
    - simple.so
+ enviroment
    - bake
    - modular
    - simplerepl
    - simplebridge
    - simplepad
    - webworker.
+ modules
    - ...

### Running the SIMPLE compiler.
```sh
$ simple
```

#### Installing on Mac
To install on Mac, the same procedures are followed but some small differences. Steps to install..
After downloading the Mac package, navigate to the home folder of SIMPLE and run commands.
The makefile for Mac is under testing and further instructions will be disbursed later.
```bash
$ bash build/SimpleOnlyBuild-Mac.sh
```
Boom, we have simple installed. Start the SIMPLE compiler with the command
```bash
$ simple
```

### Getting started.
You can check the unofficial documentation / guide to simple as the official documentation comes up. Get acquainted with SIMPLE's syntax [**HERE**](https://github.com/simple-lang/simple/blob/master/doc/Simple-Mini-Tutorial-v1.0.md)
