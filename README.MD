![simple-repl](https://i.imgur.com/qx5bbc3.png)

### About Simple
SIMPLE is a plain and innovative programming with multi-paradigm. It can be embedded in C/C++ projects. The language is portable to various OS including windows, macOS, any linux and unix distros and other OS. The language is small and fast.

### Features
Simple has features every programming language will have such as variable declarations, functional programming, Object oriented programming etc and more to come. It houses all these features as it parent architecture comes from **C**. Simple is weakly typed, no explicit end of line required and can be embedded in C and C++ projects. Portability with javascript is a major goal we're trying and going to achieve.

After downloading simple from either methods listed above, unzip/move into the SIMPLE folder from your console and follow the instructions below.
```sh
$ cd build && chmod +x Linux-Build.sh
$ ./Linux-build.sh
```
Wait for a few moments, probably a minute. The make file installs simple in a folder linux system. Simple will be available system wide when next you sign-in. start the SIMPLE compiler with the command
```sh
$ simple
```

The makefile for Mac is under testing and further instructions will be disbursed later.
```bash
$ bash build/SimpleOnlyBuild-Mac.sh
```
Boom, we have simple installed. Start the SIMPLE compiler with the command
```bash
$ simple
```
